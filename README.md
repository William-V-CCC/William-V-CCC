<h1>Hello im William Vance </h1>
<div>
Entry-level Software Engineer who is learning MERN (MongoDb, Express, React, Node.js) applications. I am interested in learning more code including Python and Lua ; I am passionate about making readable code and trying to understand as much of it as I can before planning on implementing it into any projects. Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to collaborate on different MERN projects to help expand my knowledge.
